2016 - 2018 by Martin Heide

## Cesium example apps:
* Animated GPS track on satellite terrain
* 3D model (mesh / point cloud, from laser scanner data) on satellite terrain

## How to get the apps running:
* Download CesiumJS 1.45 from https://cesiumjs.org/downloads/
  * Unzip into a new folder, I'll assume you name it `Cesium`
  * `Cesium$ npm install`
* Clone this repository into the subfolder "AppsMy" (as a sibling of the existing folder "Apps" in the Cesium folder)
  * `Cesium$ git clone https://github.com/heidemn/cesium-myapps.git AppsMy`
* `Cesium$ npm start`
* Open http://localhost:8080/AppsMy/
